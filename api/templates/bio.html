    <h2 class="mb-3">Hi! I'm Sagun Shrestha.</h2>
    <p>
      I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science specializing in Building and deploying Machine Learning models from Eastern University and a
      Bachelor’s in Manufacturing Engineering from California State University,
      Northridge. I spent several years in the aerospace and defense sector as
      an engineer before transitioning into the world of data and AI.

      My technical journey began with CNC programming and Python in college,
      which sparked a passion for automation and software development. That led
      me to work as a Python Developer in the circuit board manufacturing
      industry, building backend systems and tools to accelerate production
      workflows.

      Most recently, I worked at NBCUniversal as a Data Engineering/Machine
      Learning Intern — architecting ETL pipelines, wrangling large-scale
      datasets, and building ML models to drive real-time analytics across NBC’s
      infrastructure.

      Outside of tech, I'm a passionate cook specializing in Himalayan cuisine —
      especially Nepali Momo dumplings. On weekends, you can find me serving
      authentic street-style Momos in the Los Angeles area. Come say hi:

      I’m also a musician at heart — I love playing guitar and singing (classic
      rock & grunge are my go-tos). Check out my music covers here:
