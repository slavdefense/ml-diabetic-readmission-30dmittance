    <h2 class="mb-3">Hi! I'm Sagun Shrestha.</h2>
    <p>
      I hold a Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering from California State University, Northridge. I spent several couple of years working as an engineer in the aerospace and defense sector, where I gained valuable experience managing complex, high-stakes projects.

      During my time in college, I was introduced to CNC programming and Python, which sparked my interest in software development. That passion led me to work as a Python developer in the circuit board manufacturing industry, where I honed my skills in automation and backend development.

      As my interest in AI and machine learning grew, I realized I wanted to specialize in data engineering. To build a strong foundation, I pursued a Master’s degree in Data Science from Eastern University, with the goal of understanding machine learning in depth so I can better contribute as a data engineer in the AI space.

       I am also a passionate cook. I love cooking Himalayan cusine. Momo dumplings from Nepal are my favorites to cook. If you are ever in Los angeles area, I provide Momo dumplings in a street style setting in weekends. You can check it out here.

        Outside of tech, I’m also a part-time DJ and musician. I love playing guitar and singing(especially classic rock and metal). If you're into that vibe, feel free to check out my YouTube channel where I post music covers and performances.
